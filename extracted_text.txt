GOVERNANCE
AECI Response
The board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities
The board takes overall responsibility for AECI’s risk
management. The board is supported by the risk and the audit
committees as well as the SESC. The newly constituted SHEC
provides oversight on critical operational risks. The board and
committees provide leadership to implement the principles of
good corporate governance across AECI, ensuring all decisions
and actions are based on integrity, accountability, equality,
and transparency.
Management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related
risks and opportunities
The governance structures in place ensure that senior leaders
within the business are regularly and accurately informed of
the most important climate-related risks and opportunities.
Leadership engagements include information on a range of
relevant topics for robust debate and discussion as required.
These sessions further inform strategic and operational
interventions required to align with longer-term obligations.
The responsibility for sustainability management is specifically
delegated in the organisation. The recently appointed group
head: sustainability and ESG, has strategic responsibility for
sustainability and environmental issues and is supported by
a group sustainability steering committee and sustainability
champions from all group operations.
STRATEGY
AECI Response
AECI recognises the risk posed by
climate change and has taken significant
action to reduce its GHG emissions.
Climate change aspects influencing
AECI’s strategy include:
� Increasing legislative developments
that will result in an increasing price
for carbon, driving the need for a
reduction in emissions. There are
initiatives across the group’s global
operations which require various
region-specific actions to align with
our long-term goals
� Increased legislative developments
mandating accurate reporting of
GHG emissions in all jurisdictions
� Increased focus on reporting of
Scope 3 emissions to properly
inform a just transition strategy
� AECI has committed to a 2050
Net Zero Goal. Realisation of
this goal will be supported by
a refined strategy as required,
formalised and relevant policies, a
structured just transition pathway,
regular monitoring and review and
adaptation as required
RISK MANAGEMENT
AECI Response
AECI has a robust enterprise risk
management process in place which has
matured over several years to become
an essential management and strategic
tool. The focus of the risk management
process is not only on adverse conditions
potentially facing the business but also
on the identification of opportunities to
the advantage of the business and our
stakeholders. The risk committee of the
board ensures that relevant risks are
reviewed and conducts a “deep dive’ into
selected risks at each meeting, thereby
keeping the risk register dynamic and
relevant.
METRICS AND TARGETS
AECI Response
With 2020 marking the start of the
decade of action on the SDGs, AECI’s
sustainability strategy process was
initiated through the identification of
priority SDGs and associated metrics
for the management of performance
and improvement. The group has set
initial targets for the period up to 2025
and will be embarking on a process to
formulate additional targets for the
period up to 2030.
AECI currently uses the following
metrics to track its climate change
actions:
� Potable water consumption (m3)
� Discharge to sea or sewer (m3)
� GHG emissions (tonnes CO2e)
� Renewable energy
� Hazardous waste generated (tonnes)
� Number of environmental incidents

Environmental stewardship CONTINUED
Energy management
During the year, load shedding posed a significant challenge to our operations. This resulted in lower
electricity usage across our South African operations. In order to manage the reduced assurance of power
supply, the operations as well as administrative buildings resorted to increased use of diesel powered
generators. Consequently, while electricity usage deceased, we saw a significant increase in our overall
energy consumption.

Baselines were determined by analysing the data in the respective years of highest production over the period 2017–2019
Schirm Germany operations were not able to provide supporting evidence for their reported data related to electricity, which is
included in the group reported figures.
Managing tenant-occupied sites
AECI Property Services utilises an energy-efficient approach when planning for all building renovations
and roof replacements, as well as when removing asbestos sheeting when upgrading buildings. During
building renovations, careful attention is paid to the maximisation of natural light as this has a significant
positive impact on energy efficiency.
Carbon management
AECI has committed to a 2050 Net Zero Goal and in so doing will implement associated actions across
our global operations. Just transition will be challenging due to the carbon-intensive nature of our
production processes, exacerbated by the electricity crisis in South Africa, the lack of security in natural
gas resources across global markets and carbon trade barriers. A deeper understanding of individual
activities that make up our Scope 1 and 2 tonnes of CO2 equivalent has enabled us to direct our focus to
the most carbon-intensive business processes.
Scope 1 emissions recorded for 2022 were 267 919 tCO₂e, up from 266 291 tCO₂e in 2021.
This represents an increase of 1% and Scope 2 emissions in 2022 were 225 882 tCO₂e, down from
235 043 tCO₂e in the prior year, a 4% reduction. The total carbon footprint for the group amounts to
R 493 801* tCO₂e for 2022.
The Scope 1 emission increase was driven by higher natural gas consumption at our Schirm Germany
operations. The Scope 2 emission decrease was achieved through reduced usage of indirect emission
sources such as purchased electricity. The electricity consumption target for 2025 was achieved in 2022
with the total usage recorded at 2% below target, despite delays in commissioning our own generation of
renewable energy.
With the increasing focus on Scope 3 emissions and the requirement to incorporate Scope 3 emissions
into Science-Based Targets if these constitute greater than 40% of the total emissions, AECI embarked
on its first comprehensive Scope 3 emissions inventory in 2022. The initial results of the Scope 3
quantification exercise indicate that AECI’s Scope 3 emissions are approximately 1 602 633 tCO2e
for 2022, constituting approximately 77% of AECI’s overall carbon footprint.

For more than a decade we have been recognised as the chemical sector’s leader in implementing
abatement solutions at our own facilities. We became first movers in this regard as far back as 2006,
at the time implementing technologies that were not available in South Africa. In the process, we have
pioneered multiple applications and processes that have been adopted and amended by others in our
sector, including customers, suppliers and competitors.
Scope 3 emissions
Reliable Scope 3 calculations are not only a business requisite of growing significance, doing so is a
competitive differentiator for AECI Mining as many of our products and systems enable our customers
to reduce their own carbon footprints.
In 2022, we estimate that our products and systems saved our customers in excess of 55 000 tonnes
of their own CO2e emissions. This was achieved through clients consuming less diesel and other fuels
by using our products, and by reducing waste sent to landfill. These estimates will be refined under our
newly developed Scope 3 calculating capability from 2023 – and reported to customers and other
stakeholders.
BETTER MINING IN PRACTICE
A product that substantially reduces customers’ GHG emissions and saves
them financial capital is our Emulsion Vertical Drop System (EVDS).
The EVDS allows emulsion products to be delivered directly from surface to underground workings
at depths ranging from 35 metres to almost 1 000 metres. The system removes the need for
much of the equipment traditionally used to transport product from the surface to a mine’s
respective workplaces, in the process reducing emissions, fuel and electricity consumption.
Data from one mine deploying the EVDS reflects 90% shorter tramming distances, 71% lower
tramming times and a 14% reduction in the engine running time of mobile charging units (MCUs)
as well as a 12% reduction in fuel consumption. This project is now in the process of being
replicated in other parts of the business.
Used fuels for explosive formulations
A decade ago we began replacing virgin oil with recycled oil in our emulsion manufacturing process,
creating a closed loop system. Since 2021 our Indonesian customers have brought used oil from their
trucks’ gearboxes, maintenance yards, mechanised mining units, tractors and forklifts to our sites to be
used as inputs to manufacture emulsions.
Used oil contains multiple elements that are harmful to the environment and handling this waste in a
cost-effective and environmentally friendly way is always challenging, especially in countries where safe
waste disposal mechanisms are not available.
To end 2022, AECI Mining Explosives had recycled 2 525 000 litres of used oil, avoiding the need for
such oil to be treated elsewhere or disposed to landfill. Without reducing the bulk explosives’ performance,
the consumption of used oil in our Eco series replaces diesel which would otherwise be used in the
manufacturing process.
Employing used oil in emulsion manufacture is done by South African customers and, increasingly, by
AECI Mining customers internationally. One such international customer, Indonesia’s PT Kaltim Prima
Coal has been following this methodology since 2011, progressively ramping up the use of used oil to
100%. In 2022 the open pit coal mining company saved some 2.3 million litres of diesel as a result.
Renewable energy
Consideration of renewable energy supply is not only about reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprints
but is also about addressing security of supply at our manufacturing facilities. With this in mind, AECI
Mining will benefit from daytime solar savings as a result of planned solar installations at its facilities in
Modderfontein (4 MW installation) and Sasolburg (1.5 MW installation). Both projects remain on track
for completion during 2023.
